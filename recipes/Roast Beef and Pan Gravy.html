      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <br />
          <p>
            Combine 1 teaspoon salt per pound of beef, 1 teaspoon black pepper,
            and granulated garlic in a small bowl and mix well. Set the beef on
            a piece of butcher paper, and apply half of salt mixture evenly to
            each side, tamping it on lightly with a fork. Press the sides of the
            roast onto any seasoning that has fallen onto the paper. Place beef
            on a wire rack set over a pan. Refrigerate the “dry brined” beef,
            uncovered, for 24 hours, turning meat over once after 12 hours.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <br />
          <p>Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <br />
          <p>
            Heat oil in an oven-safe pan or skillet over high heat; add beef to
            pan and sear on both sides until nicely browned, about 3 minutes per
            side. Using tongs, pick up the meat and sear on the sides as well,
            if desired.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <br />
          <p>
            Turn off heat and add onions to the pan wherever they fit; top with
            mushrooms. Season vegetables with the 1/2 teaspoon salt. Drizzle
            melted butter over vegetables, and brush melted butter over beef.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <br />
          <p>Roast in the preheated oven for 15 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <br />
          <p>
            Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F (170 degrees C), and
            continue to roast beef until desired internal temperature is
            reached. Begin to check temperature after 15 to 20 minutes. For
            medium-rare, an instant-read thermometer inserted near the center of
            beef should reach 125 degrees F (52 degrees C). For medium, internal
            temperature should reach 130 to 135 degrees F (54 to 57 degrees C).
            Total roasting time will depend on the size of the roast.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <br />
          <p>
            Remove beef from the oven, transfer to a plate, and cover loosely
            with foil. Let rest at least 15 to 20 minutes before slicing.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <br />
          <p>
            Meanwhile, prepare the gravy. Remove mushrooms from the pan, and
            keep warm until ready to serve.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <br />
          <p>
            Melt 1 tablespoon cold butter in the pan over medium-high heat;
            sprinkle in flour, and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Whisk in
            vinegar and beef broth, and bring mixture to a boil, stirring
            occasionally. Season with salt, black pepper, and cayenne to taste,
            and add thyme leaves.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <br />
          <p>
            Continue boiling on medium-high heat until gravy reduces by about
            half and thickens slightly. Gravy can be reduced more for a thicker
            texture.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <br />
          <p>
            Once meat is rested, slice thinly at a 45-degree angle, and serve
            with mushrooms and hot gravy over the top.
